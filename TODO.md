# TODO List

## Commands
- [ ] make hardcoded command text configurable
- [ ] design a better command structure that includes help text
- [ ] finish help command
- [ ] more mod commands (change game, title and stuff)
- [ ] beatsaber commands (needs a compatible beatsaber mod first that can receive commands via some endpoint (rest maybe))

# Overlays
- [ ] move overlays from 1sec refreshed html to javascript
- [ ] implement announcements
- [ ] add a few css presets for chat/notifications
- [ ] implement a way to define css style and number of chat messages displayed per url (and maybe other options)
- [ ] I need a way o delete non-relevant chat messages so the memory won't get filled up (maybe delete on stream end and a command to clear chat)
